   Add a new student record by entering the roll number, name, and marks for FA1, FA2, FA3, FA4, Mid-Term, and Final Term. The system automatically calculates and stores:
   - Total marks for each section.
   - Overall percentage.

2. **Update Student Information**  
   Modify an existing record by updating the roll number, name, or subject marks. The system will recalculate the totals and percentage in real-time.

3. **Delete Student Record**  
   Remove a student‚Äôs record permanently by providing their roll number. Once deleted, the record is gone from the CSV file.

4. **View Student Records**  
   See all stored records displayed neatly in a tabular format. This includes:
   - Roll number
   - Student name
   - Marks for each subject
   - Total marks and overall percentage

- **Delete**: Permanently remove a student‚Äôs record from the file.

### Input Validation
The system includes validation to ensure correct data entry for:
- Marks
- Roll numbers
- Names

## üìã CSV File Format

Records are stored in a CSV file (`student.csv`) with the following columns:

| Roll No. | Name | FA1 | FA2 | Total (FA1+FA2) | FA3 | FA4 | Total (FA3+FA4) | Mid-Term | Final Term | Total (Mid + Final) | Overall % |
|----------|------|-----|-----|-----------------|-----|-----|-----------------|----------|------------|--------------------|------------|
