How to Run

Install Python:

Make sure Python is installed on your system. You can download the latest version of Python from here.

Download an IDE:
Download and install an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), preferably Python IDLE, which comes bundled with Python. Alternatively, you can use any other IDE like PyCharm, VS Code, etc.

Create a Python File:
Open your IDE and create a new Python file (e.g., student_management.py).
Copy and paste the provided code into this file.

Run the Program:
In Python IDLE, go to the Run menu and select Run Module (or press F5 on your keyboard).
This will execute the code and display the prompts in the output console.
Follow the instructions in the console to create, update, delete, or view student records.

View Output:
The program stores all student records in a CSV file named student.csv.
To check the stored data, search for the student.csv file in the directory where you saved the Python file and open it with any text editor or spreadsheet software like Excel.
